# Nonlinear Permuted Granger Causality
Repository includes:
- Code used to obtain simulated data (.R files). Data files are located at the Google Drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FqzzlJ_KDEQDeqNrzLtTre8OLD1OvVPq?usp=sharing).

- Simulation code used to generate results and figures discussed in paper (.R, .cpp, and .py files). 

- Code used to modify the application study data in Section 5 (.m file). The original data for the application study was obtained from the [CRCNS data shaing website](http://crcns.org/data-sets/ac/ac-1). We use 060802mw02 from ac-1 and cite the following works:
