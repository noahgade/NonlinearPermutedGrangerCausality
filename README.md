# Nonlinear Permuted Granger Causality
Repository includes:
- Code used to obtain simulated data (.R, .cpp files).

- Simulation code used to generate results and figures discussed in Section 4 and the Appendices (.R, .cpp files). 

- Code and data used for the application study data in Section 5 (.R file). The original data for the application study was obtained from the [CRCNS data shaing website](http://crcns.org/data-sets/ac/ac-1). We use 050802mw03 from ac-1 and cite the following works:
